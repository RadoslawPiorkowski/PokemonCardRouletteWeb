		Hello! I'm <b>Professor Oak</b>. Let me explain a few things to you.<br><br>
		As you know, I do Pokemon Research. I collect data on their nature, occurrence and behavior.<br>It is my life passion, but it is more expensive than profitable ...<br><br>
		To improve my financial situation I allowed myself to organize a small <b>'casino'</b> No, no, no, you don't have to worry, I don't want to extort any money from you! The only currency I accept are pokemon cards! <br>However, if you don't have any, I'll be happy to <b>resell</b> a pack or two<br><br>
		So let me first of all explain a few things to you:<br><br>
		- To play and have a chance of winning you <b>must have pokeomon cards.</b><br><br>
		- You will get the <b>first</b> card pack for free at "Get the cards".<br><br>
		- You can <b>purchase</b> additional packages at the same place at any time.<br><br>
		- Once every <b>24 hours</b> you can apply for a completely free card!<br><br>
		- When you have cards, nothing prevents you from getting more of them in a simple game like roulette!<br><br>
		- Get to the table, choose the card you want to bet, remembering that the rarer the card, the greater the value of your bet and the greater the chance of winning! <b>You can bet a few cards at the same time but be careful because you cannot withdraw from the bet!</b><br><br>
		- There is a draw every 20 minutes, the winner gets all cards in the pool.<br><br>
		You see? Nothing easy, in the free time between games you can admire your wonderful collection or contact me if you have any comments.<br><br>
		<b>Thank you for coming and good luck</b>!
